\begin{abstract}
The paper reviews the main MOEA for MOP and proposed a new algorithm for a certain high dimensional MOP.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

MOP is Multi-Objective Problem for short.In this paper we will review it and proposed a new algorithm.

\section{Background Introduction}

\subsection{The review for MOP}

The MOP is set as math problem and widely used in optimization problem in all industry.

\subsection{The algorithm for MOP}

The certain sort of algorithm,named MOEA,based on genetic idea,is proposed.

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular environments for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to add Comments and Track Changes}

Comments can be added to your project by highlighting some text and clicking ``Add comment'' in the top right of the editor pane. To view existing comments, click on the Review menu in the toolbar above. To reply to a comment, click on the Reply button in the lower right corner of the comment. You can close the Review pane by clicking its name on the toolbar when you're done reviewing for the time being.

Track changes are available on all our premium plans, and can be toggled on or off using the option at the top of the Review pane. Track changes allow you to keep track of every change made to the document, along with the person making the change.

\subsection{The usual steps for the algothrims}

They are as follows \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initiallization,
\item cross-over,
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item selection,
\item iteration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


\subsection{How to change the margins and paper size}

Usually the template you're using will have the page margins and paper size set correctly for that use-case. For example, if you're using a journal article template provided by the journal publisher, that template will be formatted according to their requirements. In these cases, it's best not to alter the margins directly.

If however you're using a more general template, such as this one, and would like to alter the margins, a common way to do so is via the geometry package. You can find the geometry package loaded in the preamble at the top of this example file.

\subsection{How to change the document language and spell check settings}

Overleaf supports many different languages, including multiple different languages within one document.

To configure the document language, simply edit the option provided to the babel package in the preamble at the top of this example project.

To change the spell check language, simply open the Overleaf menu at the top left of the editor window, scroll down to the spell check setting, and adjust accordingly.

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can simply upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with a tool such as JabRef. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

\subsection{Good luck!}

We hope you find Overleaf useful!
